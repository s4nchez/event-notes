#Rationale for Continuous Delivery: what does "good" look like?

* Keynote by Dave Farley [@davefarley77](http://www.twitter.com/davefarley77)
* Current state of Software Development (spoiler: not so great)
  * Scott Ambler's studies ([comparing paradigms](http://scottambler.com/2014/01/24/comparing-software-development-paradigms/), [analysis](http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/the-non-existent-software-crisis-debunki/240165910))
* What we tried:
  * Production line style (waterfall, V-model) 
  * RUP (had good things)
  * Scrum
* What we want:
  * Shorter feedback loops
  * Quick, cheap and reliable software
* Scientific Method
  * Guess -> Propose -> Predict -> Test
  * Similar to Demming's PDCA (Plan, Do, Check, Act)
* Avoiding [waste](http://www.infoq.com/articles/lean-muda-muri-mura/)
  * Waste (Muda)
  * Overburden (Muri)
  * Unnecessary Variation (Muda)
* Reducing cycle time ([Lead vs Cycle time](http://leanandkanban.wordpress.com/2009/04/18/lead-time-vs-cycle-time/))
* Continuous Delivery wroks because it's scientific method applied
* Book suggestion: [Large-Scale Agile Development](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Practical-Approach-Large-Scale-Agile-Development/dp/0321821726)
