# Confronting Complexity

* Robert Smallshire (@robsmallshire)
* Metrics for Complexity
  * Cost of imports
  * Whitespaces (indentation) -> very similar to cyclomatic complexity
    * Cheaper
* Data driven vs. Model driven
  * "Can't do double blinded tests for software"
  * Alternative: simulation (Monte Carlo etc)
* Graph of authors
  * ~7 authors per component
  * ~2 doing most of wor
  * Pairing is hard to measure, but would be interesting to see how affects that
