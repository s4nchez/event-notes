## Teaching old tricks to new dogs

* Tim Mackinnon (@iterex) and Joseph Pelrine (@josephpelrine)
* Starting questions:
  * What we used to do but don't do anymore?
  * Why?
* Old "tricks":
  * Tracker role
  * Size estimates
  * Metaphor
  * Burn-up/Burn-down (Scrum only?)
  * Integration chicken (token)
  * CRC cards
  * UML
  * Velocity
  * MoSCoW
  * At least a day for requirements
  * Planning Game
  * On site customer
  * Declaration of rights
  * Discuss XP values
  * Yesterday's weather
  * Sustainable pace

#### Integration chicken

* Then:
  * Single integration machine (required queueing)
  * Idempotence of build
  * Keep everything working
  * High chance of getting it wrong
  * Integration token
  * Intentional delay
    * Physical queueing time
    * Created slack/discussion time
* Now:
  * A lot more tool-driven: Hudson/CC/Jenkins
  * More complicated deployments
  * Allow people to forget about builds/integration

#### Yesterday's Weather

* Why?
  * Don't overcommit
  * Rebuild trust
  * Limit WIP (kind of)
  * Simple
  * Adaptative
  * Can't compare velocity over time
* Now:
  * Strongly dependency on 3rd party (libraries/open source)
  * Velocity is sometimes a target (precision vs. accuracy)
  * Kanban + SLAs
  * More trust?
  * Single item flow
 
Notes:

* velocity can be your friend (or just be used to beat developers)
* "weather" word was used exactly because it conveys it's not accurate

#### CRC Cards

* Then:
  * Physical cards
  * Real-time collaboration
  * Role playing
  * Group undertanding
* Now:
  * Assumption that "everyone knows OOP"
  * _UML_
  * Ad hoc paper design
  * Behaviour Driven Design
  * "No need to design"
  * Role instead of Class
  * Introverts struggle
  
Notes:

* OOP can be used as "classification" (how people normally learn it), or "collaboration" (harder, real life, message passing).

#### System Metaphor

* An "elevator pitch" for your system
* C3 Project: "a production line to represent payments"
* Then:
  * Shared wording for "problem" (dev/BA)
  * Naming conventions
  * Mental model
* Now:
  * Design pattern names everywhere
  * Lack of equivalent exercise/technique
